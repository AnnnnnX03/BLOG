# Welcome to Mia's Blog <img src="/img/default_avatar.png" width="70" height="70">

Hi, I'm **Mia**! 

Finally, I've decided to start writing blogs here to document my thoughts and keep track of my progress, including learning, job-hunting, and daily life.

## Why I'm Blogging Here
I have two accounts on Little Redbook:
- One for sharing **DevOps** knowledge
- Another for reviewing food in **South Australia**

Both accounts have received positive feedback. However, as these accounts become more commercialized, I realize I can't share too much of my personal life there. Typically, I save my diary entries and progress tracking locally using Word.

There are two main reasons why I decided to start posting on my **GitHub** repository:

1. It will motivate me to learn more **IT-related** knowledge.
2. I hope to eventually synchronize my blog with my personal website.
