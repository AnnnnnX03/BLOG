### Job Hunting 

Waiting for the second round of interview scheduling. 

July is supposed to be a month with more job opportunites, but I got a bit lazy this week and didn't apply many jobs.

**ðŸ‘† NEXT WEEK ðŸ‘†** 


### Book

Finished a web novel and to become less addicted to these novels, so start reading (mostly listening to) *Madame Bovary*.
This is a book that makes me reflect on my own life as I listen. Everyone has their own interpretation, and mine is that Madame Bovary in today's era would be earning as much money as possilbe to solve the puzzles of life. 

### Health

- Went to the gym 3 times
- Went mountain climbing (or hiking) once

### Event 

There was no AWS meetup this week. Maybe I should consider attending some networking meetups too.
